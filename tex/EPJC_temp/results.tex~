\section{Results}
\label{results}
In this section we discuss results of our analysis. All our results are obtained by assuming 20 ${\rm GW_{th}}$ total
thermal power of the reactor complex, a far detector of 5 kt fiducial
volume with 12\%
free-proton fraction (in weight) and 5 year
exposure time. 

First we show the expected energy distributions of the reactor neutrinos in Fig.~\ref{fig:EventDist_combine_0}.

\caption{The energy distribution of the reactor neutrino events after
 \exposure\, exposure at the baseline length $L=30,40,50$
 and 60 km, from the top to the bottom. The blue curves are for NH,
 while the red ones are for IH. The red arrows show the energy at which
 the mass hierarchy difference vanishes.}
\label{fig:EventDist_combine_0}
\end{figure}
There are four sets of curves for different baseline lengths, 30, 40, 50
and 60 km, from the top panel to the bottom panels. In each panel, the blue and red curves show the distributions for NH and IH,
respectively. The red arrow in each
panel shows the neutrino energy at which the mass hierarchy dipendent
term in eq.~(\ref{pee2}) vanishes, at the $n=1$ point in
eq.~(\ref{condition2}). The reactor neutrino events are expected to
populate in the energy range between 1.8 MeV and
8 MeV. We note here that the relative phase between the NH and IH
oscillations is reversed across the arrowed degeneracy point, as most clearly seen in
the $L = 60$ km case. 
%This reversal plays a crucial role in the mass hierarchy determination
%as we see in the Fig.~\ref{fig:EventDistmin_fit2nh_combine_30} and Fig.~\ref{fig:EventDistmin_fit2nh_combine_50}.

\caption{The same figure as
 Fig.~\ref{fig:EventDistmin_fit2nh_combine_30} but the baseline length

\label{fig:EventDistmin_fit2nh_combine_50}
\end{figure}
Fig.~\ref{fig:EventDistmin_fit2nh_combine_30}
and Fig.~\ref{fig:EventDistmin_fit2nh_combine_50} show energy
distributions for $L = 30$ and 50 km, respectively, 
in which the exact $E_{\nu}$ measurement is assumed for the upper panel,
just as in Fig.~\ref{fig:EventDist_combine_0}, whereas in the lower
panel the energy
resolution of $a = 6\%$ with $b = 0$ in eq.~(\ref{eq:Eres}) is assumed. The dashed blue curve corresponds to
the NH case, and the dashed red curve to the IH case,
while the solid curve is obtained using the parameter values fitted to
the NH data with the ``wrong'' IH assumption. At $L = 30$ km, the solid curve
almost coincides with the dashed blue one even with the exact energy
measurement, implying that it is almost impossible to distinguish
the mass hierarchy by experiments at $L =  30$ km. This is because the
small phase shift between the NH and IH predictions can be absorbed by a
small shift in $|\dmr|$ by a fraction of its present uncertainty, as
listed in Table~\ref{tb:fitting_params}. The situation only worsens by
introducing finite energy resolution.
% This is
% simply due to the fact that the mass hierarchy difference in the energy
% distribution can be absorved by the shift of $\dmr$ within
% its uncertainty since the relative phase between NH and IH oscillation
% almost the same in the relevant energy range of this experiment at $L
% omme=30$ km. 

The situation changes when the second peak of the mass hierarchy
dependent term, the $n=2$ point in eq.~(\ref{condition1}), comes into the energy range. The mass hierarchy differnece can no longer be
absorved by a shift in $\dmr$ since the relative phase
between the NH and IH oscillation changes across the degeneracy point,
resulting in the distinct difference between the dashed blue curve ( for
the NH data) and the solid curve (the best-fit under the IH
assumption) in the upper panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:EventDistmin_fit2nh_combine_50} when the neutrino energy
is exactly measured. However, once the finite energy resolution is
introduced, the phase difference in the lower energy side of the
degeneracy point is significantly smeared out since the NH and IH oscillations have
short wavelength at the low energy, and the remaining difference in the
higher energy side can again be absorbed by a small shift in $|\dmr|$,
resulting in an excellent fit (solid curve) to the NH data (blue
dashed curve) in the lower panel of
Fig.~\ref{fig:EventDistmin_fit2nh_combine_50}, shown for
$6\%/\sqrt{E/{\rm MeV}}$
energy resolution.

% To asses the rejecting power for the wrong mass hierarchy assumption more
% quantitatively, we show the $\dcT$ distribution as a function of the baseline
% length $L$ in Fig.~\ref{fig:dchi2_combine}. 
In order to quantify the mass hierarchy resolving power of the reactor
neutrino experiments, we show in Fig.~\ref{fig:dchi2_combine} the
$(\Delta\chi^2)_{min}$ value as a function of the baseline length $L$,
for several energy resolutions, $a = 2,3,4,5$ and $6\%$ (with $b=0$) in
eq.(\ref{eq:Eres}), from the top to the bottom.

 \caption{$(\dcT)_{min}$ for mass hierarchy discrimination is shown as a function of the baseline
  length $L$, when the energy resolution is varied in
  eq.~(\ref{eq:Eres}) with $b=0$ and $a=2$ to 6\%, from the top to the
  bottom. The results for \exposure\, exposure are shown by solid curves for NH, and by dashed curves for IH. The cross symbols
  show the optimal locations of the detector that maximize $(\dcT)_{min}$.}
 \label{fig:dchi2_combine}
 \end{figure}
Solid curves are for NH, while dashed curves are for IH. The results
clearly show that the mass hierarchy can be determined by those
experiments only if the energy resolution of the detector is
$3\%/\sqrt{E/{\rm MeV}}$ or better, and that the baseline length should be in the
range between 40 km and 60 km. Our findings agree with those of
Refs.~\cite{Learned:2006wy,Batygov:2008ku,Zhan:2008id,Zhan:2009rs,Ghoshal:2010wt,Ciuffoli:2012iz,Ciuffoli:2012bs,Qian:2012xh}
which are obtained by the Fourier analysis, as well as those of Refs.~\cite{Petcov:2001sy,Choubey:2003qx,Batygov:2008ku,Ghoshal:2010wt,Qian:2012xh,Ghoshal:2012ju}
that adopt the $\chi^2$ analysis similar to ours.

% The solid lines are obtained
% by fitting to the NH data with the IH assumption, while the dashed lines
% are obtained by fitting to the IH data with the NH assumption. The
% green, blue, brown, purple and red curves show the $\dcT$ for $a = 2, 3, 4, 5$
% and $6\%$ energy resolution with $b = 0\%$, where $a$ and $b$ are the
% modeling parmeter for the
% statistical and systematic error of the energy resolution, respectively, see eq.\ref{eq:Eres}. This $(\dcT)_{min}$ is the maximum value as
% discussed in Sec.\ref{chi2}, taking no binning limit; $(\dcT)_{min}$
% converges well to the maximum value for the bin size of $\sim 0.005
% \sqrt{E_{vis}(MeV)}$ or less. In the figure $\dcT$ for 4-6\% resolution
% remains at small value, less than 1.5, over the whole baseline
% range as discussed above for the 6\% resolution case. On the other hand, $(\dcT)_{min}$ distribution for 2 and 3\% has its peak
% around $L = 50$ km, reaching $(\dcT)_{min} \sim 12$ and $4$,
% respectively. This result that the detector energy resolution is
% needed to be at least less than 3\% for determining mass hierarchy agrees with what argued in the Ref.~\cite{Zhan:2008id,Zhan:2009rs} with the Fourier technique and other
% references~\cite{Qian:2012xh,Learned:2006wy} although they somewhat emphasize on the
% case of around 60 km baseline length. It also should be noted that the
% optimal baseline length $L$ shifts to shorter value as the energy resolution
% becomes larger, especially for more than 3\% resolution. This can be
% understood as follows. The finite energy resolution smears the neutrino spectrum
% more severely for longer $L$ because the wave length of the
% atmospheric neutrino oscillation is shorter for longer $L$ as seen in eq.~(\ref{pee1}). Therefore, the
% $(\dcT)_{min}$ is more reduced for longer $L$ after the smearing, and
% at some resolution the $(\dcT)_{min}$ of longer $L$ becomes smaller
% than that of shorter $L$, shifting the optimal $L$. For more than 3\%
% resolution, the peak of the $(\dcT)_{min}$ becomes not so dominant, resulting in
% the rapid shift of the optimal $L$ from 50 km.

The decrease of the $(\dcT)_{min}$ for the baseline length $L < 40$ km is due to a shift in $|\dmr|$ and
clearly seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:params}. 
\begin{figure}[htpb]

\caption{The best-fit parameter values for $\ssol ,$ $\srct,$ $\dms,$ $|\dmr|$ and
 $f_{sys}$ as functions of the baseline length $L$, when the energy
 resolution is varied in eq.~(\ref{eq:Eres}) with $b=0$ and $a=2,3$ and
 6\%. The results for \exposure\, exposure are shown by solid curves for NH, and by dashed curves
 for IH.}
\label{fig:params}
\end{figure}
There we plot the pull factor of the five fit
parameters, $\ssol$, $\srct$, $\dms$, $|\dmr|$ and $f_{sys}$, as
functions of the baseline length $L$. The pull factor of a parameter $Y$
is defined as $ \left(Y^{\,fit} -Y^{\,input}\right)/\delta Y$
with the same notation as in Sec.\ref{chi2}, and its squared contributes to the $\cT$ function eq.(\ref{eq:chi2_func}). The convention of the plots
is the same as in Fig.~\ref{fig:dchi2_combine}, where
$(\Delta\chi^2)_{min}$ stays almost zero at all $L$ for $a = 6\%$. In
Fig.~\ref{fig:params}, the fitted parameter values with the wrong
hierarchy assumption are shown by red curves for the $a = 6\%$ case. It
is clear that the excellent fits giving $(\Delta\chi^2)_{min} \sim 0$
are obtained simply by a small shift in $|\dmr|$ with a negative (NH)
or positive (IH) pull factor of 0.5 or less. The other parameters do not contribute
significantly. 
%$\srct$ seems to contribute well since its pull factor deviates from zero as much as $|\dmr|$ around $L =
%50$ km, but we checked that its contribution to reduce the $(\dcT)_{min}$ is almost
% negligible compared to $|\dmr|$. 
At large baseline lengths, $L > 80$ km, none of the model parameters
gains a significant pull factor. The small $(\Delta\chi^2)_{min}$ in the
longer $L$ region is mainly due to low statistics.

Next we discuss the effects of the systematic
error part of the energy resolution, $b$, in
eq.(\ref{eq:Eres}). Fig.~\ref{fig:dchi2_2qEresnl2} shows the $(\dcT)_{min}$
value as a function of the baseline length $L$ for different $b$ values.

 \caption{$(\dcT)_{min}$ for mass hierarchy discrimination is shown as a
  function of the baseline length $L$, when the energy resolution is
  varied in eq.~(\ref{eq:Eres}) with $a = 3\%$ and $b = 0, 0,5, 0.75$ and
  $1\%$, from the top to the bottom. The results for \exposure\, exposure
  are shown by solid curves for NH and
  by dashed curves for IH. The cross symbols
  show the optimal locations of the detector that maximize $(\dcT)_{min}$.}
 \label{fig:dchi2_2qEresnl2}
 \end{figure}
 The results for $b = 0, 0.5, 0.75$ and $1\%$ are shown from the top to
 the bottom with all $a = 3\%$. The effect of the systematic error is
significant as discussed in Ref.~\cite{Qian:2012xh},
reducing the peak value of the $(\dcT)_{min}$ from 4.5~($b=0$) to
 4~($b=0.5\%$), 3.5~(0.75\%) and 3~(1\%) for the NH case. 
%by a factor of up to 1.5; thus the mass hierarchy can be
% determined with 3-sigma significance only after 11-18 years running of the
% experiment for $a=3\%$ case. 
The location of the optimal $L$ (as shown by the cross symbol) decreases
from 52 km for $(a,b) = (3,0)\%$ to 47 km for $(a,b) = (3,1)\%$. Fig.~\ref{fig:dchi2_3qEresnl} shows the same figure but for
$b=2\%$.            
 \begin{figure}[htpb]

 \caption{The same as Fig.\ref{fig:dchi2_2qEresnl2} but for the energy
  resolution of eq.~(\ref{eq:Eres}) with $a = 2\%$ and $b = 0, 0.5, 0.75$
  and $1\%$ from the top to the bottom.}
 \label{fig:dchi2_3qEresnl}
 \end{figure}
 In this case the $(\dcT)_{min}$ reduced from 13.3~($b = 0$) to
 11.8~($b=0.5\%$), 10.3~($b=0.75\%$) and 8.5~($b=1\%$). 

The neutrino parameters can be measured accurately with this
experiment, and we show the expected statistical errors of the parameters, $\ssol, \srct, \dms$ and $|\dmr|$, in
Fig.~\ref{fig:param_errors}. 
\begin{figure}[htpb]
\resizebox{0.48\textwidth}{!}{

\caption{The statistical errors of the neutrino model parameters measured
 by this experiment as functions of the distance from the
 reactor $L$, after \exposure\, exposure. The results for both hierarchy (NH by solid and IH by dashed
 curves) and for the energy resolution of eq.(\ref{eq:Eres}) with $(a,b)=(3,0.5),(3,1)$ and
 $(6,1)\%$ are shown.}
\label{fig:param_errors}
\end{figure}
% These
% errors are rather insensitive to the energy resolution as can be
% observed from the degeneracy even between $(a,b)=(3,0.5)\%$ and $(6,1)\%$ cases, with
% an exception of the $|\dmr|$ error for which the error grows at large
% $L$ for the $(6,1)\%$ case. 
We find
\begin{align}
 \delta\ssol \sim& 4\times 10^{-3}, \nn\\
\delta \dms \sim& 3\times 10^{-7} {\rm eV^2}, \nn\\
\delta |\dmr| \sim& 7\times 10^{-6} {\rm eV^2},
 \label{eq:param_errors}
\end{align}
with the energy resolution of $(a, b) = (3,0.5)\%$ at around $L = 50$
km. Those errors are almost independent of the mass hierarchy and of
the energy resolution, with
 an exception of the $|\dmr|$ error for which the larger resolution
 results in the larger error: $|\dmr|\sim 8\times 10^{-6} {\rm eV}^2$ for the resolution of
 $(3,1)\%$ and $1.8\times 10^{-5}$ for $(6,1)\%$. The uncertainties of $\ssol$ and $\dms$
 show the rapid reduction after $L = 20$ km and stabilize at $L > 40$
 km. This is because the normalization and shape of the slowly varying
 oscillation pattern in Fig.~\ref{fig:EventDist_combine_0} determine $\ssol$ and $\dms$, respectively,
 almost independent of the energy resolution. On the other hand, $\srct$
 and $|\dmr|$ are measured most accurately at around $L\sim 1$ km,
 which motivated the first round of the reactor neutrino oscillation
 experiments such as Daya Bay~\cite{An:2012eh}, RENO~\cite{Ahn:2012nd} and
 Double Chooz~\cite{Abe:2011fz}. The error of $\srct$ quickly grows to
 the Daya Bay expectation of 5\%, assumed in this analysis, at $L>30$
 km.

Somewhat surprisingly, the error of $|\dmr|$ remains small at the level
of $1\times 10^{-6} {\rm eV}^2$  up to $L\sim 60$ km when the energy
resolution is $3\%/\sqrt{E/{\rm MeV}}$ or better. We find that this is because the
rapid oscillation pattern due to $|\dmr|$ can be resolved even after the
smearing in the observed energy, as can be seen in
Fig.~\ref{fig:EventDistmin_fit2nh_combine_50}, where the lower plots are
obtained after the Gaussian smearing with the energy resolution of
$6\%/\sqrt{E/{\rm MeV}}$. With higher energy resolution, more oscillation patterns
are recognized, and the high accuracy of the $|\dmr|$ measurement is
achieved. It is worth noticing that $7\times 10^{-6} {\rm eV}^2$ quoted
in eq.~(\ref{eq:param_errors}) corresponds to a 0.3\% measurement of $|\dmr|$.
