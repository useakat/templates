\section{Discussions and Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
In this paper we have investigated the sensitivity of the
medium baseline reactor electron-antineutrino oscillation experiments for
determining the neutrino mass hierarchy by performing the standard
$\cT$ analysis. We find that the sensitivity strongly depends on the
energy resolution and the baseline length. We confirm the previous
findings~\cite{Learned:2006wy,Batygov:2008ku,Zhan:2009rs,Ghoshal:2010wt,Ghoshal:2012ju,Ciuffoli:2012iz,Qian:2012xh} that the energy resolution better than the
$3\%/\sqrt{E/MeV}$ level is needed to determine the neutrino mass
hierarchy pattern, and that the optimal baseline length of the experiment
should be around $L\sim 50$ km. We carefully study the impacts of the
systematic error of the energy resolution by using the parameterization
of eq.(\ref{eq:Eres}), $(\delta E/E)^2 = \left(a/\sqrt{E/{\rm MeV}}\right)^2 +b^2$. We find
that 3-sigma determination of the mass hierarchy is possible for an
experiment with \exposure\, if an energy
resolution of $(a,b) = (2,0.75)\%$ is achieved, while a factor of 3
larger or longer experiment is needed to achieve the same goal for the
energy resolution of $(a,b)=(3,0.75)\%$. The optimal baseline length
which maximizes the mass hierarchy resolving power of the experiment is
found to depend slightly on the energy resolution, preferring the length
slightly shorter than 50 km for the energy resolution of
$(a,b)=(3,0.75), (3,1), (2,0.75)$ and $(2,1)\%$.  
 

% The optimal baseline length
% $L_{opt}$ is obtained at around 50 km for the energy resolution of $dE_{vis}/E_{vis} = (2-3)/\sqrt{E_{vis}}$\%, but it    
% shows the strong dependence on the energy resolution, especially on the
% statistical error $a$ of the resolution; $L_{opt}$ is
% shifted to $\sim 48, 40$ and $30$ km for $a = 4, 5$ and 6\%, respectively.
%  The shorter baseline length $L<50$ km results in small $\dcT$ since the
%  difference between
% the mass hierarchy is absorved by the $|\dmr|$ shift, while the longer
% baseline length suffers from the small statistics. Inclusion of the
% systematic error in the energy resolution affects not only on the
% $L_{opt}$ but also on the significance for the mass hierarchy determination
% itself. It reduces the $\dcT_{min}$ by a factor of 1.5 for
% $b=1\%$ w.r.t. $b=0\%$. However, even in the existence of the non-zero $b$, it is found
% that the significance for $a = 2\%$ resolution is almost twice higher
% than that for $a = 3\%$ with $b=0\%$. Improvement of the statistical
% error part to $2/\sqrt{E_{vis}}\,\%$ level is therefore very important. The 3-sigma significance is
% achieved after 4 and 13 years running of the experiment for $a = 2$ and
% $3\%$ if the systematic error is reduced to $b=0.5\%$.

It is also found that this experiment can measure the neutrino
parameters, $\ssol$, $\dms$ and $|\dmr|$, very accurately. For an
experiment of \exposure\, at
$L\sim 50$ km, which is capable of resolving the mass hierarchy pattern,
the errors can be as small as 
\begin{align*}
 \delta\ssol &\sim 4\times 10^{-3} (0.5\%), \\
 \delta \dms &\sim 3\times 10^{-7} {\rm eV^2} (0.4\%), \\
 \delta |\dmr| &\sim 7\times 10^{-5} {\rm eV^2} (0.3\%), 
\end{align*}
where the percentage values in the parentheses denote the relative
accuracy of the measurement.
