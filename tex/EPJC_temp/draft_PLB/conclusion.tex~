\section{Discussions and Conclusion}
\label{conclusion}
In this paper we have investigated the sensitivity of 
medium baseline reactor electron-antineutrino oscillation experiments for
determining the neutrino mass hierarchy by performing the standard
$\cT$ analysis.
We carefully study the impacts of the
systematic uncertainty of the energy resolution 
$(\delta E/E)^2 = \left(a/\sqrt{E/{\rm MeV}}\right)^2 +b^2$
and find that the optimal baseline length and the sensitivity
strongly depend on the
energy resolution.
% We confirm the previous
%findings~\cite{Learned:2006wy,Batygov:2008ku,Zhan:2009rs,Ghoshal:2010wt,Ghoshal:2012ju,Ciuffoli:2012iz,Qian:2012xh} that t
 The optimal baseline length
which maximizes the mass hierarchy resolving power of the experiment is
found to depend slightly on the energy resolution, preferring the length
slightly shorter than 50 km for the energy resolution of
$(a,b)=(3,0.75)\%, (3,1)\%, (2,0.75)\%$ and $(2,1)\%$.
At optimal baseline lengths,
the energy resolution better than the
$3\%/\sqrt{E/{\rm MeV}}$ level is needed to determine the neutrino mass
hierarchy pattern. 
Three sigma determination of the mass hierarchy is possible for an
experiment with \exposure\, exposure if an energy
resolution of $(a,b) = (2,0.75)\%$ is achieved, while a factor of 3
larger or longer experiment is needed to achieve the same goal for the
energy resolution of $(a,b)=(3,0.75)\%$.  
% The optimal baseline length
% $L_{opt}$ is obtained at around 50 km for the energy resolution of $dE_{vis}/E_{vis} = (2-3)/\sqrt{E_{vis}}$\%, but it    
% shows the strong dependence on the energy resolution, especially on the
% statistical uncertainty $a$ of the resolution; $L_{opt}$ is
% shifted to $\sim 48, 40$ and $30$ km for $a = 4, 5$ and 6\%, respectively.
%  The shorter baseline length $L<50$ km results in small $\dcT$ since the
%  difference between
% the mass hierarchy is absorved by the $|\dmr|$ shift, while the longer
% baseline length suffers from the small statistics. Inclusion of the
% systematic uncertainty in the energy resolution affects not only on the
% $L_{opt}$ but also on the significance for the mass hierarchy determination
% itself. It reduces the $\dcT_{min}$ by a factor of 1.5 for
% $b=1\%$ w.r.t. $b=0\%$. However, even in the existence of the non-zero $b$, it is found
% that the significance for $a = 2\%$ resolution is almost twice higher
% than that for $a = 3\%$ with $b=0\%$. Improvement of the statistical
% uncertainty part to $2/\sqrt{E_{vis}}\,\%$ level is therefore very important. The 3-sigma significance is
% achieved after 4 and 13 years running of the experiment for $a = 2$ and
% $3\%$ if the systematic uncertainty is reduced to $b=0.5\%$.
It is also found that this experiment can measure the neutrino
parameters, $\ssol$, $\dms$ and $|\dmr|$, very accurately as shown in (\ref{eq:param_errors}) for an
experiment of \exposure\, at
$L\sim 50$ km.
