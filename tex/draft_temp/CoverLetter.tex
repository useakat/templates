Dear Prof. Benjamin Grinstein,

Please find enclosed our manuscript entitled ``Determination of mass
hierarchy with medium baseline reactor neutrino experiments'' (arXiv:1210.8141) for your consideration on
its publication in Physics Letters B.

In this paper, we investigate the sensitivity of future medium baseline
reactor antineutrino experiments on the neutrino mass hierarchy by
performing the standard $\chi^2$ analysis. We carefully study the impacts
of the systematic uncertainty of the energy resolution and find that the sensitivity
and the optimal baseline length strongly depend on the energy
resolution. For the energy resolution better than 3\%, the optimal length of 50 km or shorter is preferred,
most probably achieving $(\Delta\chi^2)_{min}\sim 12$ for an experiment with
$20{\rm GW}\cdot$5kt(12\% free proton weight fraction)$\cdot$5yrs
exposure if the statistical and systematic uncertainties of the energy
resolution are 2\% and
0.75\%, respectively. We also find that this type of experiment can measure the
neutrino parameters, $\sin^22\theta_{12}, \Delta m^2_{21}$ and $|\Delta
m^2_{31}|$, very accurately with uncertainties of $\sim 0.5\%$. 


The manuscript has not been previously published, nor is it under
consideration for publication elsewhere. All the authors have read and approved the manuscript, and there is no
conflict of interest with regard to this manuscript. The authors will
transfer copyright to the publisher upon acceptance of the manuscript.

Thank you for considering our manuscript, and we are looking forward to your reply.\\
