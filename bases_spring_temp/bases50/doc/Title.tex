%\noindent
% The multi-dimensional integration and event generation package
% {\small BASES/SPRING} have been applied to many elementary processes in high energy 
% physics. Recently many of its users showed their strong interest in its
% upgrade, 
%  mainly for its application to integrals with more than ten dimension, to 
% those of functions with an alternating sign and for changing its program
% style. The new extended version of {\small BASES/SPRING V5.1} is capable to perform
% integrals with up to 50 dimensions and can subsequently generate events with
% weight one. Its ability to integrate real functions with indefinite sign is
% found to be useful in the numerical evaluation of interference effects among
% various amplitudes.
