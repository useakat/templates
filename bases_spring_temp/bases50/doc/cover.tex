\centerline{\bf ABSTRACT}
\par\vskip 1.0cm

\noindent
 The multi-dimensional integration and event generation package
 {\small BASES/SPRING} has been applied to many elementary processes in high energy 
 physics. Recently many of its users showed their strong interest in its
 upgrade, 
  mainly for its application to integrals with more than ten dimensions, to 
 those of functions with an alternating sign. The new
extended version of {\small BASES/SPRING V5.1} is capable of integrating functions with
up to 50 variables and subsequently generating events with
 weight one. Its ability to integrate real functions with indefinite sign is
 found to be useful in the numerical evaluation of interference effects among
 various amplitudes.
Along with these upgrades, the new version has renewed user-interface.
